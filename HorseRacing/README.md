Horse Racing Position Prediciton:
This repository includes a machine learning system that predicts horse racing finish positons using LightGBM with comprehensive feature engineering and hyperparameter optimzaiton


Overview: This system analyzes historical horse racing data to predict finish positions in upcoming races. It uses advanced feature engineering including:

Jockey-Trainer Combinations: Historical win rates and in-the-money statistics
Track Conditions: Standardized surface and weather conditions
Horse Performance: Past performance metrics and categorization
Race Context: Distance, class level, field size, and post position effects
Temporal Features: Days since last race and seasonal patterns


Our Model Overall Preformance :

RMSE: ~2.16 ± 0.18
MAE: ~1.72 ± 0.15
Top-3 Accuracy: ~68% (predicting horses that finish in top 3)
Win Prediction Accuracy: ~86%


If you want to use this model , create a CSV file with the following :
Required Columns

race_number: Race identifier
horse_name: Horse name
jockey: Jockey name
trainer: Trainer name
weight: Carrying weight
age: Horse age
post_position: Starting gate position

Optional but Recommended

race_type: Type of race (Stakes, Allowance, Claiming, etc.)
purse: Prize money
surface: Track surface (Dirt, Turf, etc.)
distance: Race distance
distance_unit: Distance unit (F=Furlongs, Y=Yards, M=Miles)
track_condition: Track condition (FT=Fast, GD=Good, etc.)
dollar_odds: Betting odds
last_race_date: Date of horse's last race
last_race_finish: Finish position in last race
num_past_starts: Total career starts
num_past_wins: Total career wins
num_past_seconds: Total career second-place finishes
num_past_thirds: Total career third-place finishes



For privacy concerns of our model the repoistory will only include the model PKL files and the .py file that makes the prediciton.
